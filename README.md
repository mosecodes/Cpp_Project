*** This is a sample school project for displaying my understanding of C++ ***

Features include Pointers, Memory Management, Classes, Objects, Inheritance, and Functions.

I intend to expand this project as I learn more, specifically things like user inputs for things like new students, displaying specific data, and more(?)

Thanks for visiting!
